## 📋 What is obsidian-skill?

obsidian-skill is a tool designed to help you work with your notes in Obsidian. It lets you read, create, search, and organize your notes through an easy command line interface (CLI). This means you can manage your notes without opening the Obsidian app directly. It supports Obsidian versions 1.12 and above.

This tool makes note-taking and organizing simpler for people who like to keep everything in order, including users of knowledge bases, personal knowledge management systems (PKM), or Zettelkasten note systems.
